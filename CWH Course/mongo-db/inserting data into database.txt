1. To select a database - use database_name
db is used to refer to the currently selected database.
Default database is test.

2. Inserting a DOCUMENT into a COLLECTION (Table, here its name is items) made inside a DATABASE (the  currently selected one) -
db.items.insertOne({name:"Samsung 20a",price:20000,rating:4,qty:200})
Note - insertOne() ek object lega jisse mai insert karna chahta hu.

3. insertMany() will take an array of objects to be inserted.
db.items.insertMany([{name:"Samsung 21a",price:20900,rating:4.4,qty:220},{name:"Samsung asha",price:2000,rating:3,qty:20}])

Small Note - Obviously the changes in the database are getting saved.

Imp - Insert me agr maine duplicate values wale document ko insert kar diya ek collection me to wo apne duplicate walo se values me to same rahega but Mongo gives it a unique ObjectId which makes even duplicate items unique (not data wise).

Imp - For inserting into a collection its not required to have only a specific schema of object. Schema can vary document to document inside the same collection.

Like prev 2 insertions ke baad same collection  me ye insertion valid he -
db.items.insertOne({faltu:true})

4. To display all the currently present databases -
show dbs

5. To display the name of all the collections in the currently selected database -
show collections

6. To view a COLLECTION (yani Table) -
db.Collection_name.find()

IMP NOTE - Dont use "" (strings) for numbers to avoid problems with larger numbers.
