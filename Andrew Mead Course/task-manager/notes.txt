* "mongodb" name ka npm package he jo official mongodb wale log hi manage karte he, isse mai mongodb se connect kar sakta hu. Mongoose is a 3rd party package which makes our life easy while using mongodb in node.

* jab mai MongoClient se connect karta hu tab ek connection pool banta he matlab multiple connections open ho jate he sirf ek ni.

* "_id" name ka ek unique identifier mongo laga deta he har document par.
-> This id is a 12 byte binary string.

* Mongo ke kai sare methods promises ko support karte he to I'll use Promise handling instead of callbacks.

* Mongoose se mai data ke liye models bana sakta hu, aur in models mai types bhi defined honge jisse galat type kisi field mai na jae. So, type validation he, type casting, query building etc.
-> model is basically my schema.
-> Fir basically in models ke instances banate he.

* Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) - It will basically map objects we create in Node with the documents inside of Mongo. Object ko Document se map kar diya.

* Mongoose behind the scenes mongodb wale module ko hi use karta he.

* Model ki kisi field pai validation lagana he to simply model banate waqt validate(){} function define kardo uss field ke object mai. Throw error jaha bhi gadbad ho.
// You can use validator package to validate stuff.

* Fact - REST -> Representational State Transfer.

* body-parser setup karne ke liye simply following middleware sare middlewares ke pehle likhte he -
app.use(express.json());

* default status code that express sends is 200.

* Small Note - Updating data is a PATCH request.

* Syntax for declaring an express router - const router = new express.Router();

* Hashing password before storing it in DB -
- using the brcryptjs module.
- Ye mai mongoose model mai middleware dalke karunga, this middleware will run BEFORE the "save" event is fired.

* JWT - Its a string made up of 3 parts -
<header>.<payload>.<signature>
All 3 parts are base 64 json strings.
Signature part is used for verification of the token.

* Methods that are accessible on the Model are called Model Methods.
- Defined using schema.statics.______

* Methods that are accessible on the instances are called Instance Methods.
- Defined using schema.methods._______

* If I want my app to sign in the user from multiple devices I need to generate multiple tokens for the same account and keep a track of all of the tokens generated for an account, I can simply store all of the tokens in the user's mongodb document.
